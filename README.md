# TAP-C
Time And Profit Calculator

The TAP-C(or Tapsie) is a calculator that allows you to type in your work stats, a financial goal, and it will show you how long it will take to reach that goal. I made this program because
there was no program or website readily available for this kind of thing.

# How to Use

*Hours* : In this section you type how many hours you work in an average shift

_Example_: **How many hours do you work per day? > [Whole Number]**

*Wage* : When prompted, type your hourly wage so Tapsie can use it to determine how long it'll take.

_Example_: **How much do you make per hour? > $[Whole Number]**

*Goal* : When prompted, type how much money you want to save up in total.

_Example_: **How much do you want to save up to? > $[Whole-dadada-you-get-the-idea]**

*Saved* : Type how much money you already have saved towards the cost so Tapsie can give the most accurate response for your situation.

_Example_: **How much have you saved up? > $[...]**

**Note: Tapsie won't always be 100% accurate when it comes to months because the number of days varies.**
